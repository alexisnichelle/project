Important notes, please update as needed

collision rewrite:
    character no longer moves up to top of platform, hitting side of platform stalls you
    NOTE: currently if more than half the character is off a platform it WILL push you off

5/29 made minor changes to platform position to work with new collisions
5/29 sprint works by pressing shift and running  (character can outrun own shots, this WILL damage the character)
5/29 Short jump enabled by pressing CTRL and jumping
5/29 Character takes damage from shots now, currently can take ten shots
5/29 boss is doing a simple shot routine, I have no way to test if its firing too often or two slow on my machine, will have to 
    fine tune it later

5/30 space bar to shoot instead of down key

6/01 started second level
6/02 updated respawn + functionality for 2nd level background, shortened time between boss shots, fixed player rate of fire

NEED TO FIX
-Background texture issues for second level
-Sound for title screen & different levels

We will have to test on the instructor machine, if it runs faster we may need to add a slowdown to the main rendering loop.


CAMERA EXPLANATION
    our game renders the entire level constantly, to simulate a moving camera in opengl you normally move the objects in the scene as the camera in opengl is given a fixed coordinate. in order to maintain simplicity we instead rendered an orthographic projection that clipped a section of the level the same width and height as our screen, centered upon the character's x coordinate.
    
Collision
    our game uses a modified box collider system, for platform collisions the game checks for four cases, 
for the first two:if the character's center is between the x-value edges of the platform if then checks if the platform is within the range of y the character top and bottom edge. if it is, the platform then checks if the character center is above the platform, if true the character is treated as being atop the platform and the effect of gravity is canceled, if not, the character's y velocity is zeroed out to cause a fall
    the other cases are collisions to the sides of the platforms, in these cases the character is moved out of the clipping box of the platform and has its x velocity set to zero.
