Important notes, please update as needed

collision rewrite:
    character no longer moves up to top of platform, hitting side of platform stalls you
    NOTE: currently if more than half the character is off a platform it WILL push you off

5/29 made minor changes to platform position to work with new collisions
5/29 sprint works by pressing shift and running  (character can outrun own shots, this WILL damage the character)
5/29 Short jump enabled by pressing CTRL and jumping
5/29 Character takes damage from shots now, currently can take ten shots
5/29 boss is doing a simple shot routine, I have no way to test if its firing too often or two slow on my machine, will have to 
    fine tune it later

5/30 space bar to shoot instead of down key

ADD:
-more sound
-second level
